Fetch AI and UAgent-Based Project
Welcome to the Fetch AI and UAgent-Based Project, developed by our team at the IIT Bombay Hackathon! ðŸš€

About the Project
This project leverages cutting-edge technologies to create an intelligent and efficient autonomous agent system. By combining Fetch AI's decentralized machine learning platform with UAgent-based techniques, we have developed a versatile and adaptive system that can be applied to various domains.

Key Features
Decentralized AI: We harness the power of Fetch AI's decentralized AI technology to enable real-time learning and decision-making.
UAgent Integration: Our project seamlessly integrates UAgent, providing a foundation for multi-agent systems and intelligent interaction.
Adaptability: The system adapts to changing environments, making it suitable for applications such as robotics, IoT, and more.
Efficiency: We prioritize efficiency in resource utilization, ensuring optimal performance even in resource-constrained scenarios.
